### Course Objectives
This course is designed for third- and fourth-year undergraduate students majoring in Artificial Intelligence. It provides an in-depth understanding of both fundamental principles and advanced techniques of recommender systems. The course covers essential topics such as user preference and behavior analysis, foundational algorithms for personalized product and service recommendation, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, matrix factorization, and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.
Students will also explore topics such as performance evaluation of recommender systems, scalability issues, multimodal recommendation systems, and explainable AI. Through a combination of theoretical foundations and practical case studies, students are expected to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to design and implement complex recommender systems in real-world applications.
